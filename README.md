## Bloccit: a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

# Setup

Make a copy of *config/application.example.yml* named *application.yml*.  It will be used to store credential information.  *The application.yml file must be included in .gitignore so that other people do not see your credentials once your code is pushed to Github.*
